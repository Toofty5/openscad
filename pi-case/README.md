WORK IN PROGRESS

Print-in-place enclosure for a Raspberry Pi 4.  There are existing cases but I figured I'd eliminate some screws and bring the overall size down a bit.  Early prototypes are promising but the clearances need work.  

With the parameterization I'm hoping to be able to accommodate fans and various options for the ribbon cables and GPIO stuff.
